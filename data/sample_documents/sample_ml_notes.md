## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback

### Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
