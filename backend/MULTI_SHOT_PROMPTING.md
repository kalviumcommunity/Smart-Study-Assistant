# Multi-Shot Prompting Implementation

## Overview

This Smart Study Assistant now includes a comprehensive **Multi-Shot Prompting** system that provides AI with multiple examples (2-5) to guide response format and approach. This technique produces the most consistent and well-structured responses compared to zero-shot and one-shot prompting.

## What is Multi-Shot Prompting?

Multi-shot prompting is an advanced technique where the AI is provided with multiple examples (typically 2-5) of the desired input-output format before being asked to respond to a new query. The system:

1. **Analyzes** the user's question to determine the subject area and intent
2. **Selects** multiple appropriate examples from the template library
3. **Presents** the examples to guide the AI's response format and style
4. **Generates** responses that follow the demonstrated patterns with high consistency

## Key Differences from Other Prompting Strategies

| Aspect | Zero-Shot | One-Shot | Multi-Shot |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Examples** | None provided | One example provided | Multiple examples (2-5) |
| **Consistency** | Variable format | Good consistency | Excellent consistency |
| **Response Quality** | Basic structure | Well-structured | Highly structured |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Instruction-based | Single pattern | Multiple patterns |
| **Learning Depth** | Surface level | Good understanding | Deep understanding |
| **Response Length** | Often shorter | Usually detailed | Comprehensive and detailed |

  /(?:cell|dna|gene|protein|organism)/i,
  'You are a biology expert. When explaining biological concepts:',
  [
    {
      question: "How do cells divide?",
      response: "Detailed explanation of mitosis..."
