# One-Shot Prompting Implementation

## Overview

This Smart Study Assistant now includes a comprehensive **One-Shot Prompting** system that provides AI with single examples to guide response format and approach. This technique often produces more consistent and structured responses compared to zero-shot prompting.

## What is One-Shot Prompting?

One-shot prompting is a technique where the AI is provided with exactly one example of the desired input-output format before being asked to respond to a new query. The system:

1. **Analyzes** the user's question to determine the subject area and intent
2. **Selects** an appropriate example from the template library
3. **Presents** the example to guide the AI's response format
4. **Generates** responses that follow the demonstrated pattern

## Key Differences from Zero-Shot

| Aspect | Zero-Shot | One-Shot |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Examples** | None provided | One example provided |
| **Consistency** | Variable format | More consistent format |
| **Response Length** | Often shorter | Usually more detailed |
| **Structure** | Basic structure | Well-structured following example |
| **Learning** | Instruction-based | Example-based learning |

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Subject-Specific Examples
Each subject area has carefully crafted examples:

- **Mathematics** - Step-by-step problem solving with verification
- **Science** - Structured explanations with definitions, processes, and applications
- **History** - Chronological analysis with causes, events, and significance
- **Programming** - Code examples with explanations and best practices
- **Language** - Clear definitions with examples and usage rules
- **Creative** - Structured creative guidance with techniques and examples

### ðŸ“‹ Task-Specific Examples
Specialized examples for different task types:
- `explanation` - Comprehensive concept explanations
- `problem_solving` - Systematic problem resolution
- `analysis` - Detailed topic analysis
- `comparison` - Structured comparisons
- `summary` - Organized summaries
- `tutorial` - Step-by-step guides

### ðŸŽ“ Adaptive Difficulty
Examples can be adjusted for different skill levels while maintaining the demonstrated structure.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Automatic detection with one-shot prompting
node one-shot.js "What is photosynthesis?"

# Force specific subject type
node one-shot.js --type math "Solve 4x - 7 = 21"

# Set difficulty level
node one-shot.js --level beginner "Explain quantum mechanics"

# Use task-specific prompting
node one-shot.js --task problem_solving "How do I fix a slow computer?"

# Show the example being used
node one-shot.js --show-example "What is DNA?"
```

#### Available Commands
```bash
# Show help
node one-shot.js --help

# Show available types and options
node one-shot.js --types

# Show example questions for each type
node one-shot.js --examples
