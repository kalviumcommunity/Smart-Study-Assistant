# Chain of Thought Prompting Implementation

## Overview

This Smart Study Assistant now includes a comprehensive **Chain of Thought Prompting** system that encourages AI to show explicit reasoning processes step-by-step. This technique leads to more accurate, transparent, and educational responses by making the AI's thinking process visible.

## What is Chain of Thought Prompting?

Chain of thought prompting is an advanced technique that guides AI to break down complex problems into logical steps and show its reasoning process explicitly. The system:

1. **Encourages step-by-step thinking** - AI shows each logical step
2. **Makes reasoning transparent** - Users can follow the thought process
3. **Improves accuracy** - Explicit reasoning reduces errors
4. **Enhances learning** - Students learn problem-solving approaches
5. **Builds trust** - Transparent reasoning increases confidence

## Examples

### Mathematics Example
**Input:** "If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, then speeds up and travels 180 miles in the next 1.5 hours, what is its average speed?"

**Chain of Thought Response:**
```
**Problem Analysis:** 
This is an average speed problem. I need to find total distance and total time, then use: Average Speed = Total Distance √∑ Total Time.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. First segment: 120 miles in 2 hours = 60 mph
2. Second segment: 180 miles in 1.5 hours = 120 mph  
3. Total distance: 120 + 180 = 300 miles
4. Total time: 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 hours
5. Average speed: 300 √∑ 3.5 = 85.71 mph

**Verification:** 85.71 mph is between 60 and 120 mph ‚úì

**Final Answer:** 85.71 mph
```

### Science Example
**Input:** "Why do objects fall at the same rate in a vacuum regardless of mass?"

**Chain of Thought Response:**
```
**Concept Analysis:**
This involves Newton's laws and gravitational acceleration.

**Reasoning Process:**
1. Newton's Second Law: F = ma
2. Gravitational force: F = mg
3. Therefore: mg = ma
4. Dividing by m: g = a
5. Mass cancels out completely!

**Evidence:** Apollo 15 hammer and feather experiment

**Conclusion:** Acceleration equals gravitational constant regardless of mass.
```

### Logic Example
**Input:** "All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Therefore, penguins can fly. What's wrong?"

**Chain of Thought Response:**
```
**Logical Structure Analysis:**
- Major premise: All birds can fly
- Minor premise: Penguins are birds
- Conclusion: Penguins can fly

**Reasoning Chain:**
1. Form is valid (if premises true, conclusion follows)
2. But major premise is false (counterexamples: penguins, ostriches)
3. False premise makes argument unsound
4. Valid structure ‚â† true conclusion

**Conclusion:** Logically valid but unsound due to false premise.
```

## Configuration

### Adding Custom Reasoning Templates

```javascript
import { ChainOfThoughtPromptEngine } from './src/services/chain-of-thought-prompting.js';

const engine = new ChainOfThoughtPromptEngine();

// Add custom reasoning template
engine.addCustomTemplate(
  'economics',
  /(?:economy|market|supply|demand|inflation|gdp)/i,
  'You are an economics expert. Use chain of thought reasoning for economic analysis:',
  [{
    question: "Why does inflation occur?",
    response: `**Economic Analysis:** Inflation is sustained increase in general price levels...
    
**Reasoning Process:**
1. **Money Supply**: More money chasing same goods
2. **Demand-Pull**: Demand exceeds supply
3. **Cost-Push**: Production costs increase
4. **Expectations**: Self-fulfilling prophecies

**Evidence:** Historical examples and economic data

**Conclusion:** Multiple interconnected factors drive inflation.`
  }]
);
```

### Customizing Reasoning Depth

```javascript
// Generate prompt with specific reasoning depth
const promptResult = engine.generatePrompt(userMessage, {
  promptType: 'science',
  reasoningDepth: 'deep'  // shallow, moderate, or deep
});
```
