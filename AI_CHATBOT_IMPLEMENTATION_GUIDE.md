## 🚀 Phase 1: Foundation & Core Setup

### 1.1 Project Structure Setup
**Goal**: Create the basic project structure and environment setup.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create folder structure as shown above
2. Set up virtual environment
3. Install required packages (openai, langchain, chromadb, etc.)
4. Create configuration files

**Video Content**: Explain project architecture and folder organization.

### 1.2 System and User Prompt (RTFC Framework)
**Goal**: Create effective prompts using Role, Task, Format, Context framework.

**RTFC Framework**:
- **Role**: "You are an expert AI tutor for engineering students"
- **Task**: "Help students understand concepts from their study materials"
- **Format**: "Provide clear, structured explanations with examples"
- **Context**: "Use only the provided study materials as reference"

**Implementation**: Create `src/core/prompts.py` with system and user prompt templates.

**Video Content**: Explain RTFC framework and how it improves prompt effectiveness.

### 1.3 Zero Shot Prompting
**Goal**: Implement basic prompting without examples.

**Example**:
```python
def zero_shot_prompt(question, context):
    return f"""
    Based on the following study material, answer the question clearly and concisely.
    
    Study Material: {context}
    Question: {question}
    Answer:
    """
```

**Video Content**: Explain zero shot prompting concept and when to use it.

### 1.4 One Shot Prompting
**Goal**: Provide one example to guide the AI's response format.

**Example**:
```python
def one_shot_prompt(question, context):
    return f"""
    Based on study material, answer questions with clear explanations.
    
    Example:
    Q: What is photosynthesis?
    A: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy...
    
    Study Material: {context}
    Question: {question}
    Answer:
    """
```

**Video Content**: Compare one shot vs zero shot, show improvement in response quality.

### 1.5 Multi Shot Prompting
**Goal**: Provide multiple examples for better pattern recognition.

**Implementation**: Extend one shot with 2-3 examples covering different question types.

**Video Content**: Demonstrate how multiple examples improve consistency.

### 1.6 Chain of Thought Prompting
**Goal**: Enable step-by-step reasoning for complex problems.

**Example**:
```python
def chain_of_thought_prompt(problem):
    return f"""
    Solve this step by step, showing your reasoning at each stage.
    
    Problem: {problem}
    
    Let me think through this step by step:
    1. First, I need to identify...
    2. Next, I should consider...
    3. Then, I can calculate...
    4. Finally, the answer is...
    """
```

**Video Content**: Show how CoT improves problem-solving accuracy.

### 1.7 Dynamic Prompting
**Goal**: Adapt prompts based on context and user needs.

**Implementation**: Create prompt selection logic based on question type, difficulty, and user history.

**Video Content**: Explain adaptive prompting and its benefits.

## 🔢 Phase 2: Embeddings & Similarity Functions

### 2.1 Embeddings Implementation
**Goal**: Generate and use embeddings for text similarity.

**Implementation**:
```python

class EmbeddingGenerator:
    def __init__(self, model="text-embedding-ada-002"):
        self.model = model
    
    def generate_embedding(self, text):
        response = openai.Embedding.create(
            model=self.model,
            input=text
        )
        return response['data'][0]['embedding']
```

**Video Content**: Explain what embeddings are, how they work, and their applications in LLMs.

### 2.2 Cosine Similarity Function

def cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2):
    dot_product = np.dot(vec1, vec2)
    norm1 = np.linalg.norm(vec1)
    norm2 = np.linalg.norm(vec2)
    return dot_product / (norm1 * norm2)
```

**Video Content**: Explain cosine similarity mathematics and why it's effective for embeddings.
